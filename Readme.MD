# OOP Lab Assignment

## Question 1: Prime Number and Odd/Even Checker

### Description:
Create a class called `Number` which will have one integer as a data member and two methods for checking whether the number is prime or not and whether it is odd or even.

### Requirements:
- Implement a `Number` class with:
  - **Data Member:**
    - `int value`: The number to be checked.
  - **Methods:**
    - `boolean isPrime()`: Checks if the number is prime.
    - `String oddOrEven()`: Determines if the number is odd or even.
    - `void setVal(int value)`: Sets the value of the number.
    - `int getVal()`: Gets the value of the number.
- Create another class containing the `main` method to test the `Number` class.

## Question 2: Leap Year Checker

### Description:
Create a class for checking whether a year is a leap year or not. Write a separate class for testing the above class.

### Requirements:
- Implement a `Year` class with:
  - **Data Member:**
    - `int year`: The year to be checked.
  - **Methods:**
    - `String isLeapYear()`: Checks if the year is a leap year and returns "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year". (Use only one if statement)
    - `void setYear(int year)`: Sets the value of the year.
    - `int getYear()`: Gets the value of the year.
- Create another class containing the `main` method to test the `Year` class.
